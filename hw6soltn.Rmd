This question was done by Zach Lang. From this graph, we can see that more women are widowed then men. We can also see that happiness is relatively unaffected by marriage status; the only change in the separate graphs are the counts, not the proportions. It is also clear that men and women are both proportionately 50/50 in every level of happiness, in every marriage status (except widowed, where there are simply fewer men)
